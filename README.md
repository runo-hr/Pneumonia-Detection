# Pneumonia-Detection  

## Objective
Train a deep learning model to classify Chest X-rays as either Pneumonia or Normal. Deploy the model on a web application.   

<blockquote>Status: Developing the web application </blockquote>  

## Tech Stack  
1. Tensorflow  
2. Keras  
3. Flask  
4. Python  

## Approach  
Use transfer learning to fine tune Keras MobileNet and VGG16 models.  

Deploy trained model on a flask web application. (In this case, a personal portfolio website)
