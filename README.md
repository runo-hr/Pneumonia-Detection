# Pneumonia-Detection  
<blockquote>Status</blockquote>
## Objective
Develop a Pneumonia Detection Application to classify Chest X-rays as either Pneumonia or Normal.  

## Tech Stack  
1. Tensorflow  
2. Keras  
3. Flask  
4. Python  

## Approach  
Use transfer learning to fine tune Keras MobileNet and VGG16 models.  

Deploy trained model on a flask web service. (In this case, a personal portfolio website)
